Here's a structured **Learning Requirements** section that clearly defines what knowledge is needed before working on the **File Microservice API**:

---

# 🎯 **Learning Requirements for File Microservice API**  

## **1️⃣ Rust Fundamentals (Prerequisites)**  
Before building the microservice, ensure you understand **Rust’s core concepts**, as they are essential for performance and safety.  

🔹 **Key Topics to Learn:**  
✅ **Ownership & Borrowing** – Prevents memory leaks and ensures safe concurrency.  
✅ **Error Handling** – Required for handling **invalid file uploads & API errors**.  
✅ **Async & Concurrency** – Needed for **handling multiple requests efficiently**.  

🔹 **Recommended Resources:**  
📖 **[Rust Book (Official Docs)](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)** (Ownership, Borrowing, Async)  
🎥 **[Let’s Get Rusty - Rust Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpPEoZW5IiY)**  

💡 **Requirement:**  
Must be comfortable with **Rust’s memory management, async programming, and error handling** before proceeding.  

---

## **2️⃣ Axum Framework & API Development**  
Axum is the **web framework** used for handling **requests, responses, and middleware**.  

🔹 **Key Topics to Learn:**  
✅ **Routing & Request Handling** – Understanding `GET`, `POST`, and extracting data from requests.  
✅ **Middleware** – Required for **rate limiting, logging, and CORS**.  
✅ **Response Handling** – Learn how to **structure JSON API responses**.  

🔹 **Recommended Resources:**  
📖 **[Axum Documentation](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/)**  
📖 **[Hyper Crate Documentation](https://docs.rs/hyper/latest/hyper/)** (Axum is built on Hyper)  

💡 **Requirement:**  
Must know how to **set up an Axum API, define routes, and handle JSON requests/responses**.  

---

## **3️⃣ File Upload Handling in Rust**  
Handling **multipart file uploads** requires working with **Axum’s Multipart Extractor** and **Rust’s async file system**.  

🔹 **Key Topics to Learn:**  
✅ **Handling Multipart Requests** – Extract files from HTTP requests.  
✅ **Reading & Writing Files Asynchronously** – Store and validate files safely.  
✅ **Extracting File Metadata** – Learn how to obtain file names, types, and sizes.  

🔹 **Recommended Resources:**  
📖 **[Axum Multipart Extractor](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/extract/multipart/struct.Multipart.html)**  
📖 **[Rust Async File Handling](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/fs/struct.File.html)**  

💡 **Requirement:**  
Must understand **how to handle file uploads and store metadata using Rust’s async features**.  

---

## **4️⃣ Rate Limiting & API Security**  
Preventing **abuse and excessive API usage** is crucial for performance.  

🔹 **Key Topics to Learn:**  
✅ **Rate Limiting Concepts** – Understand the **Token Bucket Algorithm**.  
✅ **Tower Middleware for Rate Limiting** – Used to **limit API requests per client**.  
✅ **Secure Headers & Validation** – Prevent abuse by validating **file types & sizes**.  

🔹 **Recommended Resources:**  
📖 **[What is Rate Limiting? (Cloudflare Guide)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-rate-limiting/)**  
📖 **[Tower Middleware for Rust](https://docs.rs/tower/latest/tower/)**  

💡 **Requirement:**  
Must know **how to implement rate limiting using Tower middleware** and **validate incoming file uploads**.  

---

## **5️⃣ JSON Serialization & API Responses**  
Since the API returns **structured JSON responses**, learning **Serde** (Rust’s JSON serialization library) is essential.  

🔹 **Key Topics to Learn:**  
✅ **Deriving Serialize & Deserialize Traits** – Convert Rust structs into JSON.  
✅ **Custom Serialization** – Format API responses properly.  

🔹 **Recommended Resources:**  
📖 **[Serde (JSON Serialization)](https://serde.rs/)**  
📖 **[Serde JSON Docs](https://docs.rs/serde_json/latest/serde_json/)**  

💡 **Requirement:**  
Must understand **how to serialize and deserialize JSON data in Rust**.  

---

## **6️⃣ Docker & Deployment**  
For **containerization and deployment**, Docker is used to package the application.  

🔹 **Key Topics to Learn:**  
✅ **Dockerizing Rust Applications** – Run the API in a container.  
✅ **Using Docker Compose** – Manage services easily.  

🔹 **Recommended Resources:**  
📖 **[Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)**  
📖 **[Deploying Rust Apps with Docker](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/docker-rust/)**  

💡 **Requirement:**  
Must be familiar with **containerizing Rust applications and using Docker Compose** for deployment.
